## Basic Information

DigitalOcean is a **cloud computing platform that provides users with a variety of services**, including virtual private servers (VPS) and other resources for building, deploying, and managing applications. **DigitalOcean's services are designed to be simple and easy to use**, making them **popular among developers and small businesses**.

Some of the key features of DigitalOcean include:

* **Virtual private servers (VPS)**: DigitalOcean provides VPS that can be used to host websites and applications. These VPS are known for their simplicity and ease of use, and can be quickly and easily deployed using a variety of pre-built "droplets" or custom configurations.
* **Storage**: DigitalOcean offers a range of storage options, including object storage, block storage, and managed databases, that can be used to store and manage data for websites and applications.
* **Development and deployment tools**: DigitalOcean provides a range of tools that can be used to build, deploy, and manage applications, including APIs and pre-built droplets.
* **Security**: DigitalOcean places a strong emphasis on security, and offers a range of tools and features to help users keep their data and applications safe. This includes encryption, backups, and other security measures.

Overall, DigitalOcean is a cloud computing platform that provides users with the tools and resources they need to build, deploy, and manage applications in the cloud. Its services are designed to be simple and easy to use, making them popular among developers and small businesses.

### Main Differences from AWS

One of the main differences between DigitalOcean and AWS is the **range of services they offer**. **DigitalOcean focuses on providing simple** and easy-to-use virtual private servers (VPS), storage, and development and deployment tools. **AWS**, on the other hand, offers a **much broader range of services**, including VPS, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, and many other services. This means that AWS is more suitable for complex, enterprise-level applications, while DigitalOcean is more suited to small businesses and developers.

Another key difference between the two platforms is the **pricing structure**. **DigitalOcean's pricing is generally more straightforward and easier** to understand than AWS, with a range of pricing plans that are based on the number of droplets and other resources used. AWS, on the other hand, has a more complex pricing structure that is based on a variety of factors, including the type and amount of resources used. This can make it more difficult to predict costs when using AWS.

## Permissions

### Team

In DigitalOcean, a **team is a group of users** who have **access** to a specific set of **resources** and **services** within the platform. Teams can be used to manage access and permissions for multiple users, allowing the owner or administrator of the team to control who has access to what resources and services.

Basically a team, **started by the owner** (the one that initially configured the billing and invited the rest of the members), will have **access to the DO resources in all the projects created within the team**.

**A project is a set of resources** (like a project in GCP).

A Digital Ocean **user can be in several teams**.

### Roles

Each **user inside a team** can have **one** of the following three **roles** inside of it:

| Role       | Shared Resources | Billing Information | Team Settings |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| **Owner**  | Full access      | Full access         | Full access   |
| **Biller** | No access        | Full access         | No access     |
| **Member** | Full access      | No access           | No access     |

**Owner** and **member can list the users** and check their **roles** (biller cannot).

## Access

### Username + password (MFA)

As in most of the platforms, in order to access to the GUI you can use a set of **valid username and password** to **access** the cloud **resources**. Once logged in you can see **all the teams you are part** of in [https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/profile](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/profile).\
And you can see all your activity in [https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/activity](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/activity).

**MFA** can be **enabled** in a user and **enforced** for all the users in a **team** to access the team.

### API keys

In order to use the API, users can **generate API keys**. These will always come with Read permissions but **Write permission are optional**.\
The API keys look like this:

```
dop_v1_1946a92309d6240274519275875bb3cb03c1695f60d47eaa1532916502361836
```

The cli tool is [**doctl**](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl#installing-doctl). Initialise it (you need a token) with:

```bash
doctl auth login #Prompted for the token
doctl auth list #List accounts
```

By default this token will be written in clear-text in Mac in `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/doctl/config.yaml`.\
