## Network Enumeration

```bash
# List networks
gcloud compute networks list
gcloud compute networks describe <network>

# List subnetworks
gcloud compute networks subnets list
gcloud compute networks subnets get-iam-policy <name> --region <region>
gcloud compute networks subnets describe <name> --region <region>

# List FW rules in networks
gcloud compute firewall-rules list
```

You easily find compute instances with open firewall rules with [https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/gl-redteam/gcp\_firewall\_enum](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-operations/gl-redteam/gcp\_firewall\_enum)

## **VPC, Networks & Firewalls in GCP**

Compute Instances are connected to VPCs ([Virtual Private Clouds](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc)). In GCP there aren't security groups, there are [**VPC firewalls**](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls) with rules defined at this network level but applied to each VM Instance. By **default** every network has two [**implied firewall rules**](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls#default\_firewall\_rules): **allow outbound** and **deny inbound**.

When a GCP project is created, a VPC called `default`is also reated, with the following firewall rules:

* **default-allow-internal:** allow all traffic from other instances on the `default` network
* **default-allow-ssh:** allow 22 from everywhere
* **default-allow-rdp:** allow 3389 from everywhere
* **default-allow-icmp:** allow ping from everywhere

{% hint style="warning" %}
As you can see, **firewall rules** tend to be **more permissive** for **internal IP addresses**. The default VPC permits all traffic between Compute Instances.
{% endhint %}

### **Enumerating public ports**

Perhaps you've been unable to leverage your current access to move through the project internally, but you DO have read access to the compute API. It's worth enumerating all the instances with firewall ports open to the world - you might find an insecure application to breach and hope you land in a more powerful position.

In the section above, you've gathered a list of all the public IP addresses. You could run nmap against them all, but this may taken ages and could get your source IP blocked.

When attacking from the internet, the default rules don't provide any quick wins on properly configured machines. It's worth checking for password authentication on SSH and weak passwords on RDP, of course, but that's a given.

What we are really interested in is other firewall rules that have been intentionally applied to an instance. If we're lucky, we'll stumble over an insecure application, an admin interface with a default password, or anything else we can exploit.

[Firewall rules](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls) can be applied to instances via the following methods:

* [Network tags](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags)
* [Service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls#serviceaccounts)
* All instances within a VPC

Unfortunately, there isn't a simple `gcloud` command to spit out all Compute Instances with open ports on the internet. You have to connect the dots between firewall rules, network tags, services accounts, and instances.

We've automated this completely using [this python script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/gl-redteam/gcp\_firewall\_enum) which will export the following:

* CSV file showing instance, public IP, allowed TCP, allowed UDP
* nmap scan to target all instances on ports ingress allowed from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0)
* masscan to target the full TCP range of those instances that allow ALL TCP ports from the public internet (0.0.0.0/0)
