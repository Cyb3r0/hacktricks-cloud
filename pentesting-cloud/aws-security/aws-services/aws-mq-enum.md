## AWS - MQ

**Message brokers** allow software systems, which often use different programming languages on various platforms, to communication and exchange information. **Amazon MQ** is a managed message broker service for **Apache ActiveMQ** and **RabbitMQ** that streamlines setup, operation, and management of message brokers on AWS. With a few steps, Amazon MQ can provision your message broker with support for software version upgrades.

### AWS - RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is a **message-queueing software** also known as a _message broker_ or _queue manager._ Simply said; it is **software where queues are defined**, to which **applications connect** in order to **transfer a message** or messages.

A message can include any kind of information. It could, for example, have information about a process or task that should start on another application (which could even be on another server), or it could be just a simple text message. The queue-manager software stores the messages until a receiving application connects and takes a message off the queue. The receiving application then processes the message.

AWS offers to **host and manage in an easy way RabbitMQ servers**.

### AWS - ActiveMQ

Apache ActiveMQ¬Æ is the most popular open source, multi-protocol, Java-based **message broker**. It supports industry standard protocols so users get the benefits of client choices across a broad range of languages and platforms. Connect from clients written in JavaScript, C, C++, Python, .Net, and more. Integrate your multi-platform applications using the ubiquitous **AMQP** protocol. Exchange messages between your web applications using **STOMP** over websockets. Manage your IoT devices using **MQTT**. Support your existing **JMS** infrastructure and beyond. ActiveMQ offers the power and flexibility to support any messaging use-case.

aws mq list-brokers

# Get broker info
aws mq describe-broker --broker-id <broker-id>
## Find endpoints in .BrokerInstances
## Find if public accessible in .PubliclyAccessible

# List usernames (only for ActiveMQ)
aws mq list-users --broker-id <broker-id>

# Get user info (PASSWORD NOT INCLUDED)
aws mq describe-user --broker-id <broker-id> --username <username>

# Lits configurations (only for ActiveMQ)
aws mq list-configurations
## Here you can find if simple or LDAP authentication is used
## If Ldap, you can see LDAP server info

# Creacte Active MQ user
aws mq create-user --broker-id <value> --password <value> --username <value> --console-access
```
