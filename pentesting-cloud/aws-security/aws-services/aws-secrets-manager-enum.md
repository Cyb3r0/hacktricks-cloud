## AWS Secrets Manager

AWS Secrets Manager allows you to **remove any hard-coded secrets within your application and replacing them with a simple API call** to the aid of your secrets manager which then services the request with the relevant secret. As a result, AWS Secrets Manager acts as a **single source of truth for all your secrets across all of your applications**.

AWS Secrets Manager enables the **ease of rotating secrets** and therefore enhancing the security of that secret. An example of this could be your database credentials. Other secret types can also have automatic rotation enabled through the use of lambda functions, for example, API keys.

Access to your secrets within AWS Secret Manager is governed by fine-grained IAM identity-based policies in addition to resource-based policies.

To allow a user form a different account to access your secret you need to authorize him to access the secret and also authorize him to decrypt the secret in KMS. The Key policy also needs to allows the external user to use it.

**AWS Secrets Manager integrates with AWS KMS to encrypt your secrets within AWS Secrets Manager.**

### **Enumeration**

```bash
aws secretsmanager list-secrets #Get metadata of all secrets
aws secretsmanager list-secret-version-ids --secret-id <secret_name> # Get versions
aws secretsmanager describe-secret --secret-id <secret_name> # Get metadata
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id <secret_name> # Get value
```
