## EFS

**Elastic File System** (Amazon EFS) provides **simple, scalable file storage**. With Amazon EFS, **storage capacity is elastic**, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so that your applications have the storage they need, when they need it.

### Network Access

These file systems will be **accessible from specific networks**, so you will need some access inside the network to access to the NFS service.\
Moreover, the **EFS** should have in the **subnetwork** endpoint that you can access a **security group allowing access to NFS** (2049 port). Without this, you **won't be able to contact the NFS service** (this isn't create by default).\
For more information about how to do this check: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38632222/aws-efs-connection-timeout-at-mount](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38632222/aws-efs-connection-timeout-at-mount)

### IAM Access

By **default** anyone with **network access to the EFS** will be able to mount, **read and write it even as root user**. However, File System policies could be in place **only allowing principals with specific permissions** to access it.\
For example, this File System policy **won't allow even to mount** the file system if you **don't have the IAM permission**:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "efs-policy-wizard-2ca2ba76-5d83-40be-8557-8f6c19eaa797",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "efs-statement-e7f4b04c-ad75-4a7f-a316-4e5d12f0dbf5",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            },
            "Action": "",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-east-1:318142138553:file-system/fs-0ab66ad201b58a018",
            "Condition": {
                "Bool": {
                    "elasticfilesystem:AccessedViaMountTarget": "true"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Note that to mount file systems protected by IAM you MUST use the type "efs" in the mount command:

```bash
sudo mkdir /efs
sudo mount -t efs -o tls,iam  <file-system-id/EFS DNS name>:/ /efs/
# To use a different pforile from ~/.aws/credentials
# You can use: -o tls,iam,awsprofile=namedprofile
```

### Access Points

**Access points** are **application**-specific entry points **into an EFS file system** that make it easier to manage application access to shared datasets.\
They can **enforce** **user identity**, including the user‚Äôs POSIX groups, different **root directory** and different **IAM policies.**

**You can mount the File System from an access point with something like:**

```bash
# Use IAM if you need to use iam permissions
sudo mount -t efs -o tls,[iam],accesspoint=<access-point-id> \
    <file-system-id/EFS DNS> /efs/
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that even trying to mount an access point you still need to be able to **contact the NFS service via network**, and if the EFS has a file system **policy**, you need **enough IAM permissions** to mount it.
{% endhint %}

### Enumeration

```bash
# Get filesystems and access policies (if any)
aws efs describe-file-systems
aws efs describe-file-system-policy --file-system-id <id>

# Get subnetworks and IP addresses where you can find the file system
aws efs describe-mount-targets --file-system-id <id>
aws efs describe-mount-target-security-groups --mount-target-id <id>

# Get other access points
aws efs describe-access-points

# Get replication configurations
aws efs describe-replication-configurations

# Find for NFS in EC2 networks
nmap -Pn -p 2049 --open 10.10.10.0/24

sudo mkdir /efs

## Mount found
sudo apt install nfs-common
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport <IP>:/ /efs

## Mount with efs type
## You need to have installed the package amazon-efs-utils
sudo mount -t efs <file-system-id/EFS DNS name>:/ /efs/
```
