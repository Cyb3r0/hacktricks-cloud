## Detective

**Detective** makes it easy to **analyze, investigate, and quickly identify the root cause** of potential security issues or suspicious activities. Amazon Detective automatically **collects log data** from your AWS resources and uses **machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory** to build a linked set of data that enables you to easily conduct faster and more efficient security investigations.

Amazon Detective **simplifies the process of digging deeper in security issues** by enabling your security teams to easily investigate and **quickly get to the root cause of a finding**. Amazon Detective can analyze trillions of events from multiple data sources such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon GuardDuty, and automatically creates a **unified, interactive view of your resources,** users, and the interactions between them over time. With this unified view, you can visualize all the details and context in one place to identify the underlying reasons for the findings, drill down into relevant historical activities, and quickly determine the root cause.
