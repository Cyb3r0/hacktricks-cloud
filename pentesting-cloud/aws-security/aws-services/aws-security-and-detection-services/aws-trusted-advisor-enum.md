## Trusted Advisor

The main function of Trusted Advisor is to **recommend improvements across your AWS account** to help optimize and hone your environment based on **AWS best practices**. These recommendations cover four distinct categories. It's a is a **cross-region service**.

1. **Cost optimization:** which helps to identify ways in which you could **optimize your resources** to save money.
2. **Performance:** This scans your resources to highlight any **potential performance issues** across multiple services.
3. **Security:** This category analyzes your environment for any **potential security weaknesses** or vulnerabilities.
4. **Fault tolerance:** Which suggests best practices to **maintain service operations** by increasing resiliency should a fault or incident occur across your resources.

The full power and potential of AWS Trusted Advisor is only really **available if you have a business or enterprise support plan with AWS**. **Without** either of these plans, then you will only have access to **six core checks** that are freely available to everyone. These free core checks are split between the performance and security categories, with the majority of them being related to security. These are the 6 checks: service limits, Security Groups Specific Ports Unrestricted, Amazon EBS Public Snapshots, Amazon RDS Public Snapshots, IAM Use, and MFA on root account.\
Trusted advisor can send notifications and you can exclude items from it.\
Trusted advisor data is **automatically refreshed every 24 hours**, **but** you can perform a **manual one 5 mins after the previous one.**
