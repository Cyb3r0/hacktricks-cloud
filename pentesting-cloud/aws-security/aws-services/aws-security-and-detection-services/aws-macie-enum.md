## Macie

The main function of the service is to provide an automatic method of **detecting, identifying, and also classifying data** that you are storing within your AWS account.

The service is backed by **machine learning**, allowing your data to be actively reviewed as different actions are taken within your AWS account. Machine learning can spot access patterns and **user behavior** by analyzing **cloud trail event** data to **alert against any unusual or irregular activity**. Any findings made by Amazon Macie are presented within a dashboard which can trigger alerts, allowing you to quickly resolve any potential threat of exposure or compromise of your data.

Amazon Macie will automatically and continuously **monitor and detect new data that is stored in Amazon S3**. Using the abilities of machine learning and artificial intelligence, this service has the ability to familiarize over time, access patterns to data.\
Amazon Macie also uses natural language processing methods to **classify and interpret different data types and content**. NLP uses principles from computer science and computational linguistics to look at the interactions between computers and the human language. In particular, how to program computers to understand and decipher language data. The **service can automatically assign business values to data that is assessed in the form of a risk score**. This enables Amazon Macie to order findings on a priority basis, enabling you to focus on the most critical alerts first. In addition to this, Amazon Macie also has the added benefit of being able to **monitor and discover security changes governing your data**. As well as identify specific security-centric data such as access keys held within an S3 bucket.

This protective and proactive security monitoring enables Amazon Macie to **identify critical, sensitive, and security focused data such as API keys, secret keys, in addition to PII (personally identifiable information) and PHI data**.

This is useful to avoid data leaks as Macie will detect if you are exposing people information to the Internet.

It's a **regional service**.

It requires the existence of IAM Role 'AWSMacieServiceCustomerSetupRole' and it needs AWS CloudTrail to be enabled.

Pre-defined alerts categories:

* Anonymized access
* Config compliance
* Credential Loss
* Data compliance
* Files hosting
* Identity enumeration
* Information loss
* Location anomaly
* Open permissions
* Privilege escalation
* Ransomware
* Service disruption
* Suspicious access

The **alert summary** provides detailed information to allow you to respond appropriately. It has a description that provides a deeper level of understanding of why it was generated. It also has a breakdown of the results.

The user has the possibility to create new custom alerts.

**Dashboard categorization**:

* S3 Objects for selected time range
* S3 Objects
* S3 Objects by PII - Personally Identifiable Information
* S3 Objects by ACL
* High-risk CloudTrail events and associated users
* High-risk CloudTrail errors and associated users
* Activity Location
* CloudTrail Events
* Activity ISPs
* CloudTrail user identity types

**User Categories**: Macie categorises the users in the following categories:

* **Platinum**: Users or roles considered to be making high risk API calls. Often they have admins privileges. You should monitor the pretty god in case they are compromised
* **Gold**: Users or roles with history of calling APIs related to infrastructure changes. You should also monitor them
* **Silver**: Users or roles performing medium level risk API calls
* **Bronze**: Users or roles using lowest level of risk based on API calls

**Identity types:**

* Root: Request made by root user
* IAM user: Request made by IAM user
* Assumed Role: Request made by temporary assumed credentials (AssumeRole API for STS)
* Federated User: Request made using temporary credentials (GetFederationToken API fro STS)
* AWS Account: Request made by a different AWS account
* AWS Service: Request made by an AWS service

**Data classification**: 4 file classifications exists:

* Content-Type: list files based on content-type detected. The given risk is determined by the type of content detected.
* File Extension: Same as content-type but based on the extension
* Theme: Categorises based on a series of keywords detected within the files
* Regex: Categories based on specific regexps

The final risk of a file will be the highest risk found between those 4 categories

The research function allows to create you own queries again all Amazon Macie data and perform a deep dive analysis of the data. You can filter results based on: CloudTrail Data, S3 Bucket properties and S3 Objects

It possible to invite other accounts to Amazon Macie so several accounts share Amazon Macie.
