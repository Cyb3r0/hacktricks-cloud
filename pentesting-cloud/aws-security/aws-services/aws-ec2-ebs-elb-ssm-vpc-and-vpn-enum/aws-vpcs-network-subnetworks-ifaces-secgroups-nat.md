In this post I will try to explain how are all those elements related.

A **VPC** contains a **network CIDR** like 10.0.0.0/16 (with its **routing table** and **network ACL**).

This VPC network is divided in **subnetworks**, so a **subnetwork** is directly **related** with the **VPC**, **routing** **table** and **network ACL**.

Then, **Network Interface**s attached to services (like EC2 instances) are **connected** to the **subnetworks** with **security group(s)**.

Therefore, a **security group** will limit the exposed ports of the network **interfaces using it**, **independently of the subnetwork**. And a **network ACL** will **limit** the exposed ports to to the **whole network**.

Moreover, in order to **access Internet**, there are some interesting configurations to check:

* A **subnetwork** can **auto-assign public IPv4 addresses**
* An **instance** created in the network that **auto-assign IPv4 addresses can get one**
* An **Internet gateway** need to be **attached** to the **VPC**
  * You could also use **Egress-only internet gateways**
* You could also have a **NAT gateway** in a **private subnet** so it's possible to **connect to external services** from that private subnet, but it's **not possible to reach them from the outside**.
  * The NAT gateway can be **public** (access to the internet) or **private** (access to other VPCs)
