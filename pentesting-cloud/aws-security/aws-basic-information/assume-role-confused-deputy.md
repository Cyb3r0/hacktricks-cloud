## Assume Role Impersonation

The [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API\_AssumeRole.html) action from AWS STS is what allows a principal to request credentials for another principal to impersonate him. When calling it, it returns an access key ID, secret key, and a session token for the specified ARN.

As a Penetration Tester or Red Teamer, this technique is useful to privesc (as explained [**here**](../aws-privilege-escalation/aws-sts-privesc.md#sts-assumerole)), but it's the most obvious techniqye to privesc, so it won't caught the attacker by surprise.

In order to assume a role in the same account if the **role to assume is allowing specifically a role ARN** like in:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<acc_id>:role/priv-role"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

The role **`priv-role`** in this case, **doesn't need to be specifically allowed** to assume that role (with that allowance is enough).

However, if a role is allowing an account to assume it, like in:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<acc_id>:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

The role trying to assume it will need a **specific `sts:AssumeRole` permission** over that role **to assume it**.

If you try to assume a **role** **from a different account**, the **assumed role must allow it** (indicating the role **ARN** or the **external account**), and the **role trying to assume** the other one **MUST** to h**ave permissions to assume it** (in this case this isn't optional even if the assumed role is specifying an ARN).

## Confused Deputy Problem

If you **allow an external account (A)** to access a **role** in your account, you will probably have **0 visibility** on **who can exactly access that external account**. This is a problem, because if another external account (B) can access the external account (A) it's possible that **B will also be able to access your account**.

Therefore, when allowing an external account to access a role in your account it's possible to specify an `ExternalId`. This is a "secret" string that the external account (A) **need to specify** in order to **assume the role in your organization**. As the **external account B won't know this string**, even if he has access over A he **won't be able to access your role**.

However, note that this `ExternalId` "secret" is **not a secret**, anyone that can **read the IAM assume role policy will be able to see it**. But as long as the external account A knows it, but the external account **B doesn't know it**, it **prevents B abusing A to access your role**.

Example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "AWS": "Example Corp's AWS Account ID"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
    "Condition": {
      "StringEquals": {
        "sts:ExternalId": "12345"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
