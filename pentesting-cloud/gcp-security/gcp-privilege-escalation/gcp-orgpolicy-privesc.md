## orgpolicy

### `orgpolicy.policy.set`

This method does **not necessarily grant you more IAM permissions**, but it may **disable some barriers** that are preventing certain actions. For example, there is an Organization Policy constraint named _appengine.disableCodeDownload_ that prevents App Engine source code from being downloaded by users of the project. If this was enabled, you would not be able to download that source code, but you could use _orgpolicy.policy.set_ to disable the constraint and then continue with the source code download.

The screenshot above shows that the _appengine.disableCodeDownload_ constraint is enforced, which means it is preventing us from downloading the source code. Using _orgpolicy.policy.set_, we can disable that enforcement and then continue on to download the source code.

The exploit script for this method can be found [here](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/orgpolicy.policy.set.py).
