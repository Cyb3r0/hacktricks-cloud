## cloudbuild

### `cloudbuild.builds.create`

With this permission you can **submit a cloud build**. The cloudbuild machine will have in it‚Äôs filesystem by **default a token of the powerful cloudbuild Service Account**: `<PROJECT_NUMBER>@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com` . However, you can **indicate any service account inside the project** in the cloudbuild configuration.\
Therefore, you can just make the machine exfiltrate to your server the token or **get a reverse shell inside of it and get yourself the token** (the file containing the token might change).

You can find the original exploit script [**here on GitHub**](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/cloudbuild.builds.create.py) (but the location it's taking the token from didn't work for me). Therefore, check a script to automate the [**creation, exploit and cleaning of a vuln environment here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp\_privesc\_scripts/blob/main/tests/f-cloudbuild.builds.create.sh) and a python script to get a reverse shell inside of the cloudbuild machine and [**steal it here**](https://github.com/carlospolop/gcp\_privesc\_scripts/blob/main/tests/f-cloudbuild.builds.create.py) (in the code you can find how to specify other service accounts)**.**

### `cloudbuild.builds.update`

**Potentially** with this permission you will be able to **update a cloud build and just steal the service account token** like it was performed with the previous permission (but unfortunately at the time of this writing I couldn't find any way to call that API).
