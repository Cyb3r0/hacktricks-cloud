## Generic Interesting Permissions

### \*.setIamPolicy

If you owns a user that has the **`setIamPolicy`** permission in a resource you can **escalate privileges in that resource** because you will be able to change the IAM policy of that resource and give you more privileges over it.\
This permission can also allow to **escalate to other principals** if the resource allow to execute code and the iam.ServiceAccounts.actAs is not necessary.

* _cloudfunctions.functions.setIamPolicy_
  * Modify the policy of a Cloud Function to allow yourself to invoke it.

There are tens of resources types with this kind of permission, you can find all of them in [https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/permissions-reference](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/permissions-reference) searching for setIamPolicy.

### \*.create, \*.update

These permissions can be very useful to try to escalate privileges in resources by **creating a new one or updating a new one**. These can of permissions are specially useful if you also has the permission **iam.serviceAccounts.actAs** over a Service Account and the resource you have .create/.update over can attach a service account.

### \*ServiceAccount\*

This permission will usually let you **access or modify a Service Account in some resource** (e.g.: compute.instances.setServiceAccount). This **could lead to a privilege escalation** vector, but it will depend on each case.
