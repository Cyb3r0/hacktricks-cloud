## **Resource hierarchy**

Google Cloud uses a [Resource hierarchy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy) that is similar, conceptually, to that of a traditional filesystem. This provides a logical parent/child workflow with specific attachment points for policies and permissions.

At a high level, it looks like this:

```
Organization
--> Folders
  --> Projects
    --> Resources
```

A virtual machine (called a Compute Instance) is a resource. A resource resides in a project, probably alongside other Compute Instances, storage buckets, etc.

## **IAM Roles**

There are **three types** of roles in IAM:

* **Basic/Primitive roles**, which include the **Owner**, **Editor**, and **Viewer** roles that existed prior to the introduction of IAM.
* **Predefined roles**, which provide granular access for a specific service and are managed by Google Cloud. There are a lot of predefined roles, you can **see all of them with the privileges they have** [**here**](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#predefined\_roles).
* **Custom roles**, which provide granular access according to a user-specified list of permissions.

There are thousands of permissions in GCP. In order to check if a role has a permissions you can [**search the permission here**](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/permissions-reference) and see which roles have it.

**You can also** [**search here predefined roles**](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#product\_specific\_documentation) **offered by each product.**

**You can find a** [**list of all the granular permissions here**](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/custom-roles-permissions-support)**.**

#### Basic roles

| Name             | Title  | Permissions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **roles/viewer** | Viewer | Permissions for **read-only actions** that do not affect state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.                                                                                                                    |
| **roles/editor** | Editor | All **viewer permissions**, **plus** permissions for actions that modify state, such as changing existing resources.                                                                                                                               |
| **roles/owner**  | Owner  | <p>All <strong>Editor</strong> permissions <strong>and</strong> permissions for the following actions:</p><ul><li>Manage roles and permissions for a project and all resources within the project.</li><li>Set up billing for a project.</li></ul> |

You can try the following command to specifically **enumerate roles assigned to your service account** project-wide in the current project:

```bash
PROJECT=$(curl http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id \
    -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google" -s)
ACCOUNT=$(curl http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/email \
    -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google" -s)
gcloud projects get-iam-policy $PROJECT  \
    --flatten="bindings[].members" \
    --format='table(bindings.role)' \
    --filter="bindings.members:$ACCOUNT"
```

Don't worry too much if you get denied access to the command above. It's still possible to work out what you can do simply by trying to do it.

More generally, you can shorten the command to the following to get an idea of the **roles assigned project-wide to all members**.

```
gcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT-ID]
```

Or to see the IAM policy [assigned to a single Compute Instance](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute/instances/get-iam-policy) you can try the following.

```
gcloud compute instances get-iam-policy [INSTANCE] --zone [ZONE]
```

## **Organization Policies**

The IAM policies indicates the permissions principals has over resources via roles which ara assigned granular permissions. Organization policies **restrict how those service can be used or which features are enabled disabled**. This helps in order to improve the least privilege of each resource in the gcp environment.

## **Terraform IAM Policies, Bindings and Memberships**

As defined by terraform in [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/google\_project\_iam](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/google\_project\_iam) using terraform with GCP there are different ways to grant a principal access over a resource:

* **Memberships**: You set **principals as members of roles** **without restrictions** over the role or the principals. You can put a user as a member of a role and then put a group as a member of the same role and also set those principals (user and group) as member of other roles.
* **Bindings**: Several **principals can be binded to a role**. Those **principals can still be binded or be members of other roles**. However, if a principal which isn‚Äôt binded to the role is set as **member of a binded role**, the next time the **binding is applied, the membership will disappear**.
* **Policies**: A policy is **authoritative**, it indicates roles and principals and then, **those principals cannot have more roles and those roles cannot have more principals** unless that policy is modified (not even in other policies, bindings or memberships). Therefore, when a role or principal is specified in policy all its privileges are **limited by that policy**. Obviously, this can be bypassed in case the principal is given the option to modify the policy or privilege escalation permissions (like create a new principal and bind him a new role).

## **Service accounts**

Virtual machine instances are usually **assigned a service account**. Every GCP project has a [default service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#default\_service\_account), and this will be assigned to new Compute Instances unless otherwise specified. Administrators can choose to use either a custom account or no account at all. This service account **can be used by any user or application on the machine** to communicate with the Google APIs. You can run the following command to see what accounts are available to you:

```
gcloud auth list
```

**Default service accounts will look like** one of the following:

```
PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
```

A **custom service account** will look like this:

```
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME@PROJECT_NAME.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

If `gcloud auth list` returns **multiple** accounts **available**, something interesting is going on. You should generally see only the service account. If there is more than one, you can cycle through each using `gcloud config set account [ACCOUNT]` while trying the various tasks in this blog.

### **Access scopes**

The **service account** on a GCP Compute Instance will **use** **OAuth** to communicate with the Google Cloud APIs. When [access scopes](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#accesscopesiam) are used, the OAuth token that is generated for the instance will **have a** [**scope**](https://oauth.net/2/scope/) **limitation included**. This defines **what API endpoints it can authenticate to**. It does **NOT define the actual permissions**.

When using a **custom service account**, Google [recommends](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#service\_account\_permissions) that access scopes are not used and to **rely totally on IAM**. The web management portal actually enforces this, but access scopes can still be applied to instances using custom service accounts programatically.

There are three options when setting an access scope on a VM instance:

* Allow default access
* All full access to all cloud APIs
* Set access for each API

You can see what **scopes** are **assigned** by **querying** the **metadata** URL. Here is an example from a VM with "default" access assigned:

```
$ curl http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/scopes \
    -H 'Metadata-Flavor:Google'

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.write
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management.readonly
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append
```

The most interesting thing in the **default** **scope** is **`devstorage.read_only`**. This grants read access to all storage buckets in the project. This can be devastating, which of course is great for us as an attacker.

Here is what you'll see from an instance with **no scope limitations**:

```
curl http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/scopes -H 'Metadata-Flavor:Google'
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
```

This `cloud-platform` scope is what we are really hoping for, as it will allow us to authenticate to any API function and leverage the full power of our assigned IAM permissions.

It is possible to encounter some **conflicts** when using both **IAM and access scopes**. For example, your service account may have the IAM role of `compute.instanceAdmin` but the instance you've breached has been crippled with the scope limitation of `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute.readonly`. This would prevent you from making any changes using the OAuth token that's automatically assigned to your instance.

## Default credentials <a href="#default-credentials" id="default-credentials"></a>

**Default service account token**

The **metadata server** available to a given instance will **provide** any user/process **on that instance** with an **OAuth token** that is automatically used as the **default credentials** when communicating with Google APIs via the `gcloud` command.

You can retrieve and inspect the token with the following curl command:

```bash
curl "http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token" \
    -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google"
```

Which will receive a response like the following:

```json
{
      "access_token":"ya29.AHES6ZRN3-HlhAPya30GnW_bHSb_QtAS08i85nHq39HE3C2LTrCARA",
      "expires_in":3599,
      "token_type":"Bearer"
 }
```

This token is the **combination of the service account and access scopes** assigned to the Compute Instance. So, even though your service account may have **every IAM privilege** imaginable, this particular OAuth token **might be limited** in the APIs it can communicate with due to **access scopes**.

**Application default credentials**

When using one of Google's official GCP client libraries, the code will automatically go **searching for credentials** following a strategy called [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production).

1. First, it will check would be the [**source code itself**](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#passing\_the\_path\_to\_the\_service\_account\_key\_in\_code). Developers can choose to statically point to a service account key file.
2. The next is an **environment variable called `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`**. This can be set to point to a **service account key file**.
3. Finally, if neither of these are provided, the application will revert to using the **default token provided by the metadata server** as described in the section above.

Finding the actual **JSON file with the service account credentials** is generally much **more** **desirable** than **relying on the OAuth token** on the metadata server. This is because the raw service account credentials can be activated **without the burden of access scopes** and without the short expiration period usually applied to the tokens.
