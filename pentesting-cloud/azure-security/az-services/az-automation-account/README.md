## Basic Information

Azure Automation delivers a cloud-based automation, operating system updates, and configuration service that supports consistent management across your Azure and non-Azure environments. It includes process automation, configuration management, update management, shared capabilities, and heterogeneous features.

These are like "**scheduled tasks**" in Azure that will let you execute things (actions or even scripts) to **manage**, check and configure the **Azure environment**.

### Run As Account

When **Run as Account** is used, it creates an Azure AD **application** with self-signed certificate, creates a **service principal** and assigns the **Contributor** role for the account in the **current subscription** (a lot of privileges).\
Microsoft recommends using a **Managed Identity** for Automation Account.

## Compromise Runbooks & Jobs

**Runbooks** allows you to **execute arbitrary PowerShell** code. This could be **abused by an attacker** to steal the permissions of the attached principal (if any).\
In the **code** of **Runbooks** you could also find **sensitive info** (such as creds).

If you can **read** the **jobs**, do it as they **contain** the **output** of the run (potential **sensitive info**).

### Hybrid Worker

A Runbook can be run in a **container inside Azure** or in a **Hybrid Worker.**\
****The **Log Analytics Agent** is deployed on the VM to register it as a hybrid worker.\
The hybrid worker jobs run as **SYSTEM** on Windows and **nxautomation** account on Linux.\
Each Hybrid Worker is registered in a **Hybrid Worker Group**.

Therefore, if you can choose to run a **Runbook** in a **Windows Hybrid Worker**, you will execute **arbitrary commands** inside that machine as **System**.

## Compromise State Configuration (SC)

Azure Automation **State Configuration** is an Azure configuration management service that allows you to write, manage, and compile PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) [configurations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/configurations/configurations) for nodes in any cloud or on-premises datacenter. The service also imports [DSC Resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/resources/resources), and assigns configurations to target nodes, all in the cloud. You can access Azure Automation State Configuration in the Azure portal by selecting **State configuration (DSC)** under **Configuration Management**.

### RCE

It's possible to abuse SC to run arbitrary scripts in the managed machines.
