# Dynamic Groups



Dynamic groups are groups that has a set of rules configured and all the users or devices are added to the group is they match the rules.

For example, users in a department might be automatically set in a specific group.

Note that every time a user or device attribute is changed, dynamic rules are rechecked.

And when a new rule is created all devices and users are checked.

Azure RBAC roles can be assigned to dynamic groups, but it's not possible to add AzureAD roles to dynamic groups

This feature requires Azure AD premium P1 license.

### Privesc

By default any user can invite guests in Azure AD

If a dynamic group rule gives permissions to users based on attributes that can be set in a new guest, it's possible to create a guest with this attributes and escalate privileges. It's also possible for a guest to manage he own profile and change these attributes.
