## Unauthenticated Cognito

Cognito is an AWS service that enable developers to **grant their app users access to AWS services**. Developers will grant **IAM roles to authenticated users** in their app (potentially people willbe able to just sign up) and they can also grant an **IAM role to unauthenticated users**.

For basic info about Cognito check:

{% content-ref url="../aws-services/aws-cognito-enum/" %}
[aws-cognito-enum](../aws-services/aws-cognito-enum/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Identity Pool ID

Identity Pools can grant **IAM roles to unauthenticated users** that just **know the Identity Pool ID** (which is fairly common to **find**), and attacker with this info could try to **access that IAM rol**e and exploit it.\
Moreoever, IAM roles could also be assigned to **authenticated users** that access the Identity Pool. If an attacker can **register a user** or already has **access to the identity provider** used in the identity pool you could access to the **IAM role being given to authenticated** users and abuse its privileges.

[**Check how to do that here**](../aws-services/aws-cognito-enum/cognito-identity-pools.md).

### User Pool ID

By default Cognito allows to **register new user**. Being able to register a user might give you **access** to the **underlaying application** or to the **authenticated IAM access role of an Identity Pool** that is accepting as identity provider the Cognito User Pool. [**Check how to do that here**](../aws-services/aws-cognito-enum/cognito-user-pools.md#registration).
